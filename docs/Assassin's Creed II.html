<h2>Story Summary</h2>
<p1>The plot is set in a fictional history setting and follows the centuries-old struggle between the <u>Assassins</u>, who fight for peace with free will, and the <u>Knights Templars</u>, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and follows <u>Desmond Miles</u> as he relives the genetic memories of his ancestor <u>Ezio Auditore da Firenze</u>. The main narrative takes place at the height of the Renaissance in Italy during the 15th and early 16th century. Players can explore <u>Florence, Venice, Tuscany and Forl√¨</u> as they guide Ezio on a quest for vengeance against those responsible for betraying his family. The primary focus is to utilize the player's combat and stealth abilities, as Desmond begins to uncover the mysteries left behind by an ancient race known as the First Civilization in the hope of ending the conflict between the Assassins and Templars.</p1>
